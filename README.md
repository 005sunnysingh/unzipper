# The Unzipper

The Unzipper extracts .zip and .rar archives or .gz files on webservers. It detects .zip/.rar/.gz archives and let you choose which one to extract (if there are multiple archives available).

It's handy if you do not have shell access. E.g. if you want to upload a lot of files (php framework or image collection) as archive - because it is much faster than uploading each file by itself.


## Requirements    
PHP 5.3 and newer
(If you still run PHP < 5.6 you should consider updating PHP. These old PHP versions do not get any security updates and your site may be vulnerable.)


## Usage
* Download unzipper.php and place it in the same directory as your .zip archive.
* In Browser type URL to unzipper.php
* Choose .zip, .rar archive or .gz file you want to extract
* Optionally select an extraction path, defaults to current directory
* Click "Unzip Archive"
