# The Unzipper

The Unzipper extracts .zip archives on webservers. It detects .zip archives and let you choose which one to extract (if there are multiple archives available).

It's handy if you do not have shell access. E.g. if you want to upload a lot of files (php framework or image collection) as archive - because it is much faster than uploading each file by itself.


## Usage
* Download unzipper.php and place it in the same directory as your .zip archive.
* In Browser type URL to unzipper.php
* Choose .zip archive you want to extract
* Click "Unzip Archive"
