# The Unzipper

The Unzipper extracts .zip archives or .gz files on webservers. It detects .zip/.gz archives and let you choose which one to extract (if there are multiple archives available).

It's handy if you do not have shell access. E.g. if you want to upload a lot of files (php framework or image collection) as archive - because it is much faster than uploading each file by itself.


## Usage
* Download unzipper.php and place it in the same directory as your .zip archive.
* In Browser type URL to unzipper.php
* Choose .zip archive you want to extract
* Click "Unzip Archive"
